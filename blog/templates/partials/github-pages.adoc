== Deploy to GitHub Pages

Check if you already have the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file, if you don't create it:

..github/workflows/deploy.yml
[source,yaml]
----
## Deploy to GH-Pages for your Quarkus Roq blog.
name: Roq Site Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]   # Switch to the branch which should be deployed to GitHub Pages
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Generate Roq Site
        uses: quarkiverse/quarkus-roq@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}   # Used to automatically get the GitHub Pages url
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    permissions:
      pages: write      # to deploy to Pages
      id-token: write   # to verify the deployment originates from an appropriate source
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
----

Then to enable GitHub Pages:

1. *Open* your GitHub repository page
2. **Go to** Settings->Page
3. *Pick:* `Source: GitHub Actions`, that's enough (no save button)

It's all good, restart your deploy workflow and enjoy!
