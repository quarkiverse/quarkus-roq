<1> **Roq Data Files**
The `data/` directory contains data files like `menu.yml` and `tags.yml`. These files can hold structured data used across the site.

<2> **Content Files**
The `content/` directory is where all content of the site that will be generated as pages resides (.html, .md, .adoc*, .json, .xml, ...)

<3> **Collections**
The `posts/` directory is the default collection in Roq, it is optional. It holds content files for blog posts or similar structured documents. You can configure multiples collections (recipes, events, ...).

<4> **Additional pages**
You may provide additional pages files like `roq-bottom.md` outside a collection. You can also use sub-directories which will be part of the resulting path.

<5> **Index File**
The `index.html` file is required and serves as the homepage. It provides site-wide data using FrontMatter.

<6> **Static Assets**
The `static/` directory holds static assets, such as images, CSS, or JavaScript files. These files are configurable and will not be processed.

<7> **Templates**
The `templates/` directory is optional as templates can be provided by a theme. It contains Qute templates for partials and layouts.

<8> **Qute Partials**
The `partials/` directory contains reusable Qute template fragments, such as `head.html` and `pagination.html`, which can be included in layouts.

<9> **Layouts**
The `layouts/` directory defines the structure for pages and documents. For example:
- `base.html` is the main layout.
- `page.html` and `post.html` are specific layouts for pages and posts.

<10> **Build files**
The build file such as a `pom.xml` is needed to configure the build. It contains dependencies for your site such as theme and plugins.
