Adding RSS is as easy as adding this tag to your `<head>` section:

```html
  \{#rss site /}
```

It will automatically use the Frontmatter data about all your blog posts to generate a proper Atom RSS feed link at `rss.xml`.

Like this:
```
{#rss site /}

```

The Atom Syndication Format is an XML language used for web feeds. A web feed (also called ‘news feed’ or ‘RSS feed’) is a data format used for providing users with frequently updated content. Content distributors syndicate a web feed, thereby allowing users to subscribe a channel to it. A typical scenario of web-feed use might involve the following: a content provider publishes a feed link on its site which end users can register with an aggregator program (also called a feed reader or a newsreader) running on their own machines.

```xml
{#include fm/rss.html}
```
