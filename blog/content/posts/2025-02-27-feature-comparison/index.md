Here‚Äôs a feature comparison with some popular SSGs to highlight how Roq stacks up.


| Feature           | Roq                                           | Hugo                         | Jekyll                               | JBake                        |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Performance**  | Fast, and leveraging Quarkus dev-mode         | Extremely fast (written in Go) | Slower due to Ruby and plugins       | Slower, runs on Java with Freemarker/Groovy templates |
| **Templating**   | Qute (simple & readable)                      | Go templates (powerful but complex) | Liquid (easy but limited)            | Freemarker, Groovy, or Thymeleaf |
| **Extensibility** | Leverages Quarkus extensions                  | Limited plugin system | Large plugin ecosystem               | Limited, Java-based plugins |
| **Setup**        | Requires JDK (for now)                        | Single binary install       | Requires Ruby & Bundler              | Requires Java & Gradle/Maven |
| **Dynamic Features** | Can integrate with Quarkus for hybrid use     | Mostly static, some JS workarounds | Plugins enable some dynamic behavior | Fully static |
| **Community**    | Growing, part of Quarkus ecosystem            | Large, well-established | Large, long history                  | Niche, less active |
| **Learning Curve** | Begginer friendly, easier for Java developers | Can be difficult due to Go templates | Complex to setup and update          | Moderate, depends on template engine |


### A Quick Note About Roq

Roq is highly extensible through [plugins]({site.url('/docs/plugins')}), which are built as Quarkus extensions (dependencies). Key features like SEO and Sitemap are already available, with more features in the works, including:
- search ([Issue #141](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-roq/issues/141))
- image processing ([Issue #42](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-web-bundler/issues/42))

A current limitation is the lack of a theme catalog to help get started ([Issue #270](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-roq/issues/270)). While it‚Äôs not difficult to convert themes from other SSGs to Roq, I‚Äôm working on an AI-based theme converter ([Issue #365](https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-roq/issues/365)) to make this process even easier üòÅ.

Considering its young age, Roq is still very complete!

### Conclusion
Jekyll is widely used but comes with the complexity of setting up Ruby environments, which often causes headaches. It has a strong plugin system and is easy to get started with, but performance can be an issue for large sites.

JBake was the only Java-based SSG before Roq, but it feels outdated compared to modern alternatives. It lacks the flexibility and performance optimizations of newer SSGs like Hugo and Roq.

Roq aims to offer a **modern, Java-friendly alternative** that brings the ease of Jekyll, the speed of Hugo (to some extent), and the flexibility of Quarkus.
