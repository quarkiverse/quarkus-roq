My mind is getting blown by how much Quarkus was made for Static Site Generation. I just implemented a new plugin to generate tag pages and that was soooo easy.

To use it:

```xml
 <dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.roq</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-roq-plugin-tagging</artifactId>
    <version>...</version>
</dependency>
```

and adding a new `layouts/tag.html` page or any layout with `tagging: [name of collection]` as FM data.

For more info [check out the doc](https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-roq/dev/quarkus-roq-plugins.html#_roq_plugin_tagging).
