So your site is growing larger and larger and so it becomes harder and harder to find anything you wrote more than a few weeks ago.
And that is frustrating.

__**Words vanish, writing remains**__

Yes... But if it remains buried deep in a pile of posts, it won't be of any use to any one.

It seems you need to add a search engine to your site.

But... you choose static generation for a reason, right ? Economy of resources, matters to you. And so you don't want to add a full-blown search engine like ElasticSearch or Solr.

And guess what ? We couldn't agree more **with you** 🤩. We think you are _perfectly_ right, and that people should listen to you more. At least that's what we do. 👂

So we did a bit of research and found out exactly what you need :

https://lunrjs.com/[Lunr.js], it's a small, full-text search engine written in JavaScript. It runs in the browser based on a static generated json index and don't need any other third party services ✨.

**Tadddaaah! ** We wrote a Lunr.js plugin for Roq.
