Two prominent websites have recently completed their migration to Roq: https://wildfly.org/[`wildfly.org`, window=_blank] and https://wildfly.org/[`jbang.dev`, window=_blank]. These migrations mark a significant milestone in the adoption of Roq as a modern static site generator.

The official WildFly project site, `wildfly.org`, has transitioned from its legacy setup on Jekyll. This move brings faster build times, simplified deployment, and better integration with modern Java tooling.

WildFly is a powerful, modular, and lightweight Java application server that provides all the tools you need to build robust enterprise applications.

Similarly, `jbang.dev`, the home of the JBang scripting tool, has now adopted Roq for its site generation instead of Jekyll.

JBang let Students, Educators and Professional Developers create, edit and run self-contained source-only Java programs with unprecedented ease.

== Roq's Enhanced AsciiDoc Support

Roq now offers robust support for AsciiDoc content. This includes:

- **Header parsing**: Roq can extract metadata from AsciiDoc headers, enabling dynamic routing and layout selection without FrontMatter header.
- **Includes support**: Authors can modularize content using AsciiDoc includes, making documentation more maintainable and reusable.

These features make Roq an excellent choice for documentation-heavy sites and technical blogs.

== More Sites Coming Soon!

The momentum doesn't stop here. Several other sites are currently in the pipeline to migrate to Roq, signaling growing confidence in its capabilities and developer experience. With its blazing-fast builds and flexible content handling, Roq is quickly becoming the go-to solution for modern static site generation in the Java ecosystem.

Stay tuned for more announcements!
