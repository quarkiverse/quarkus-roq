This Christmas, I’m Roq-ing a cool new feature (inspired by Hugo 😅): it is possible to attach static files to posts and pages. They will be served relative to the page. 🎁🤩

I love it because it allows to put all the content related to one page or post in the same place. Bonus, images are displayed on previews since they are relative to the template.

For example here is a sample pdf: [link](sample.pdf).


**Fun fact:** [@parisjug](https://www.parisjug.org/) is already using this feature on their site (which is on Hugo 🤪)!

The doc for this feature is [here](https://iamroq.com/docs/basics/#page-files).
