So you plan to do a series of blog posts about a given subject.
This is as simple as adding a `series` attribute to the front matter of your posts.

*Step 1:* Add the Series plugin in your dependencies file:

[source,xml]
----
 <dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.roq</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-roq-plugin-series</artifactId>
    <version>${quarkus-roq.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

*Step 2:* Edit the layout for your posts, for example when using roq-default theme:

[source,html]
.templates/layouts/roq-default/post-series.html
----
---
layout: theme-layouts/roq-default/post
---

{#include partials/roq-series /} <1>

{#insert /} <2>
----
<1> This will add the series partial before the post content, if it’s declared.
<2> This is the post content.

And finally, use this layout and add the series attribute in the Front Matter of the posts you want to join.

[source,yaml]
----
---
layout: series-post
title: Assemble you blog post in a series
description: Automatically series header for your posts
tags: plugin, frontmatter, guide, series
author: John Doe
series: My series Title <1>
---
----
<1> You should use the exact same title for all documents in the series.

It will add the following at the head of your post:

image::{page.image('series.foo.png')}[Series header]

A bit like what you see at the very begining of this post.
