Roq is a rookie and still needs to prove itself, but already, there are good signs ☀️

**The very first to give Roq a shot was David**—a talented developer from the Quarkus Team! No images on your blog, David? Maybe it’s because you don’t want them stealing the spotlight from your content, right? Don’t worry, I’ll create an Unsplash plugin just for you. It will automatically pick images based on your content, so you don’t have to lift a finger!

David's was nice enough to share about switching from Jekyll to Roq (in his first Roq post:):

I live near Marseille and know the owners of MarsJug. **I decided to try switching their website to Roq**. Their original site consisted of plain HTML pages with raw event details hardcoded, making updates and maintenance a nightmare. It took just a minute to convince them of the benefits of using Roq.

Jotak, a Red Hat developer working on the NetObserv project, used to lean more towards Vert.x than Quarkus—something we debated quite a bit back in the day. It’s a shame he had to step away from Java development due to project constraints a few years ago. **Still, he managed to convince his team (working with Go and React) to switch to Roq 🚀**.
