So your blog is growing larger and larger and so it becomes harder and harder to find anything you wrote more than a few weeks ago.
And that is frustrating.

[.text-center]
__**Words vanish, writing remains**__

Yes.

But if it remains buried deep in a pile of posts, it won't be of any use to any one.

So you need to add a search engine to your blog.

But you choose static generation for a reason, right ? Economy of resources, matters to you. And so you don't want to add a full-blown search engine like ElasticSearch or Solr.

And guess what ? We couldn't agree more **with you** ðŸ¤©. We think you are _perfectly_ right, and that people should listen to you more. At least that's what we do. ðŸ‘‚

So we did a bit of research and found out exactly what you need :

https://lunrjs.com/[Lunr.js] is here for you. It's a small, full-text search engine written in JavaScript that runs in the browser and don't need any other third party services âœ¨.

So we wrote a plugin for you to be able to add Lunr.js to your blog.

Full documentation is available link:/docs/plugins/#plugin-lunr[here], don't wait any longer, go check it out.
