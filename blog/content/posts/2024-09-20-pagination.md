Adding pagination to your Roq site is an easy way to improve content navigation. Let’s walk through how to implement pagination and customize its behavior in your site.

## Step 1: Basic Pagination Setup

First, include the following in your frontmatter on the page which will iterate on the paginated collection:

```yaml
layout: main
paginate: posts
```

Next, in your template, loop through the paginated posts using:

```html
\{#for post in site.collections.posts.paginated(page.paginator)}
<article class="post">
  ...
</article>
\{/for}
```

## Step 2: Adding Pagination Controls

To add pagination controls, add something like this to `partials/pagination.html` and include it in your page `\{#include partials/pagination.html/}`:

```html
\{#include fm/pagination.html}
\{#newer}<i class="fa fa-long-arrow-left" aria-hidden="true"></i>\{/newer}
\{#older}<i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>\{/older}
\{/include}
```

You can further customize your pagination by setting the page size and link format:
```yaml
paginate: 
  size: 4
  collection: posts
  link: posts/page-:page
```

With these steps, you can create a flexible pagination system to improve your site’s navigation.
