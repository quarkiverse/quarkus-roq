<h1>About Roq</h1>

<p>Roq stands out in the Java development community as a powerful static site generator, bridging the gap between the
  likes of Gatsby, Hugo, and the broader backend community.
  As Andy Damevin explains, while tools like Jekyll once filled this space, they‚Äôve become outdated and cumbersome,
  especially with Ruby‚Äôs limitations.
  Roq offers a modern solution, leveraging Quarkus with no configuration needed, allowing developers to start quickly
  using Codestart and simply editing their site directory.
</p>
<p>With GitHub Actions support out-of-the-box, Roq is easy to use for beginners, but also flexible enough to provide
  Java hooks for advanced users.
</p>

  <p><b>This tool is a testament to how extensible and powerful Quarkus is, offering a low-risk
    yet highly capable platform that will evolve as demand grows.</b></p>
