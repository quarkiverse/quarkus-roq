= Roq Basics

By default, your site files should be located in the **project root directory**.

TIP: you may also put it in the Java resources (i.e. `src/main/resources/`).

== Directory Structure

The default directory structure is:
[source]
----
my-site/
├── data/                                // <1>
│   ├── menu.yml
│   └── tags.yml
│
├── content/                             // <2>
│   ├── posts/                           // <3>
│   │   ├── 2024-10-14-roq-ssg.md
│   │   └── 2024-10-20-heart-roq.md
│   │
│   ├── roq-bottom.md                    // <4>

    │   ├── head.html
    │   └── pagination.html
    │
    └── layouts/                         // <9>
        ├── base.html
        ├── page.html

<1> **Roq Data Files**
The `data/` directory contains data files like `menu.yml` and `tags.yml`. These files can hold structured data used across the site.

<2> **Content Files**
The `content/` directory is where all content of the site that will be generated as pages resides (.html, .md, .adoc*, .json, .xml, ...)

<3> **Collections**
The `posts/` directory is the default collection in Roq, it is optional. It holds content files for blog posts or similar structured documents. You can configure multiples collections (recipes, events, ...).

<4> **Additional Files**
Content files like `roq-bottom.md` outside a collection will be treated as pages.

<5> **Index File**
The `index.html` file is required and serves as the homepage. It provides site-wide data using FrontMatter.

<6> **Static Assets**
The `static/` directory holds static assets, such as images, CSS, or JavaScript files. These files are configurable and will not be processed.

<7> **Templates**
The `templates/` directory is optional as templates can be provided by a theme. It contains Qute templates for partials and layouts.

<8> **Qute Partials**
The `partials/` directory contains reusable Qute template fragments, such as `head.html` and `pagination.html`, which can be included in layouts.

<9> **Layouts**
The `layouts/` directory defines the structure for pages and documents. For example:
- `base.html` is the main layout.
- `page.html` and `post.html` are specific layouts for pages and posts.

<10> **Build files**
The build file such as a `pom.xml` is needed to configure the build. It contains dependencies for your site such as theme and plugins.


=== Qute and FrontMatter

All templates can use the awesome type-safe https://quarkus.io/guides/qute-reference[Qute] template engine.

TIP: Type-safety doesn't make it more complex, it just means that using wrong variables and such will result in build error. This way it won't leak in production.

Templates for layout, documents and pages can declare a FrontMatter (referred as FM data) header delimited by  two `---`.
This header contains yaml data used to configure many things such as:

* Routing
* Data for the templates
* Content generation
* Pagination

=== Layouts and Partials

For your site, you will have one or more kind of pages, this is what we call "layouts", located by default in `templates/layouts/`. For example:

* `main`: the base layout for all kind of pages
* `page`: the layout of normal pages
* `post`: the layout for blog posts
* `recipe`: the layout for recipes or whatever

A layout can be included in pages and documents through the `layout` FrontMatter key (e.g. `layout: page`).

TIP: Roq layouts are using the Qute `include` section under the hood to achieve template inheritance. For more details, see the Qute documentation on includes: https://quarkus.io/guides/qute-reference#include_helper[Qute includes]. Unlike partials, layouts can also define Frontmatter data, which is inherited along with the template structure.

You can also prepare partial templates. They are located by default in `templates/partials/`. For example:

* `pagination.html`
* `head.html`

NOTE: if you don't already have layouts and partials in your project, <<install-theme>> or create your own templates (https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-roq/tree/main/theme/default/src/main/resources/templates[example templates]).

[#install-theme]
=== Install a theme

To install a theme, simply add the dependency to your pom.xml. Example with Roq's default theme:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.roq</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-roq-theme-default</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

It will provide templates, scripts and styles for your site. To use a theme layout, refer to it with `:theme/` prefix (there is an example in the next part). For advanced usage, refer to the link:quarkus-roq-frontmatter.adoc#themes[*Theme section*].

=== Site index template

Your site index template is required and should be located in `content/index.html`.

[source,html]
.content/index.html
----
---
title: Hello Roqers // <1>
description: It is time to start Roqing 🎸!
layout: :theme/main //<2>
---

<h1>Hello fellow Roqers 🤘</h1>

<p>
  With Roq, it is very easy to a link to another.
  <a href="{site.url('/roq-bottom')}">page</a>. // <3>
</p>

----

<1> The index.html also describe your `site` information through a FrontMatter header.
<2> The layout to use (in this case `:theme/main` which refers to the `main` layout from the theme).
<3> We use the `{site.url(path)}` using Qute to manual resolve other pages urls.

TIP: There are different ways to link your pages as explained in the  link:quarkus-roq-frontmatter.adoc#links[Links & Urls] section.

=== Variables

You can use Qute to access site and pages data. For this use the `site` and `page` variables:

* The `site` variable allow to access site global info from any page, document, layout or partial.

=== Pages

Any directory without the `_` prefix in the site directory will be scanned for pages content.

Let's create your first page and spice things up a bit by using Markdown.

[source,html]
.roq-bottom.md
----
---
title: Roq Bottom
description: When you hit Roq bottom, try Roq to climb back up!
layout: :theme/page
link: /climb-back-up <1>
the-rope: You Roq! <2>
---

# Roq Bottom

If you thought you hit Roq Bottom, take this 🪢 because :

__{page.data.the-rope}!__ <3>

----

<1> you can use `link` to give this page a custom link (by default it will use the file-name).
<2> you can add other FM data.
<3> FM data is available through `page.data`.

=== Asciidoc support

Asciidoc is supported by Roq, though partially for the moment.

All the formatting features are available. But others such as _diagrams_ are not yet supported.

Custom attributes can also be used, but be sure to escape their use -`{custom-attribute}`-. Other wise the Qute rendering engine will try to interpolate them.


==== Includes

The standard Asciidoc include is not supported, but you can use Qute includes instead:

. Place your file in a folder under the `template` directory (for example `partials`)
. Use Qute include directive `{# partials/your_included_file.adoc/}` to inject it

==== Images

The standard `imagedir` attribute is not supported.

You should instead place your images under the `static/assets/images` folder, and reference them with the image macro :

 image::{site.imagesDirUrl.resolve('your_image.png')}[Image description]


=== Collections

Collections are a great way to group related content such as blog posts, recipes, member of a team or talks at a conference.
Once created you can easily iterate and link to them.

By default, Roq is configured with a `posts` collection using the `content/posts` directory. Let's create our first post:

[source,html]
.content/posts/2024-10-14-roq-solid.md
----
---
title: Roq bad puns
description: Roq is very good for bad puns 🤭
layout: :theme/post <1>
tags: <2>
  - funny
  - ai
img: 2024/10/roq-solid.jpg
---

# {page.title} <3>

Here is a list of puns suggested by Chat GPT:
1.	Roq and Rule – A play on “rock and roll,” implying dominance or success.
2.	Between a Roq and a Hard Place – Classic pun meaning stuck in a difficult situation.
3.	Roq Solid – Something that is extremely reliable or stable.
4.	You Roq! – A compliment, suggesting someone is awesome or does something well.
5.	Roq Bottom – Referring to the lowest possible point, often used metaphorically.
6.	Roq the Boat – To cause trouble or disturb the status quo.
7.	Roq Star – A person who excels or stands out in their field.
8.	Let’s Roq – Slang for getting started or doing something exciting.
9.	Roq On! – An enthusiastic way to say “keep going” or “stay awesome.”
10.	Roqy Road – Could be literal (the type of road) or metaphorical for a difficult journey.
11.	Roq of Ages – A historical reference, often implying something long-standing and unchanging.
12.	Roq the Cradle – Can be literal or a pun about nurturing or starting something new.
13.	Roqy Relationship – A tumultuous or unstable relationship.
14.	Heavy as a Roq – Something burdensome or difficult to manage.
15.	Stone Cold Roq – Referring to something very cool or emotionless.

----
<1> This time we use the `post` layout from the theme.
<2> You can define tags (see link:quarkus-roq-plugins.adoc#plugin-tagging[Plugins] to create pages for tags).
<3> You have shortcut on the `page` to access `title` and `description`.

Then let's edit our index page to show the list of posts:

[source,html]
.content/index.html
----
---
title: Hello Roqers
description: It is time to start Roqing 🎸!
layout: main
---

<h1>Hello fellow Roqers 🤘</h1>


{#for post in site.collections.posts} // <1>
<article class="post">
  {#if post.image}
  <a class="post-thumbnail" style="background-image: url({post.image})" href="{post.url}"></a> // <2> <3>
  {/if}
  <div class="post-content">
    <h2 class="post-title"><a href="{post.url}">{post.title}</a></h2>
    <p>{post.description}</p>
    <span class="post-date">{post.date.format('yyyy, MMM dd')}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;—&nbsp;</span> // <4>
    <span class="post-words">
      {post.readTime} minute(s) read <5>
    </span>
  </div>
</article>
{/for}
----
<1> You can use `site.collections.[collection id]` to access the full list of documents (it is also possible to link:quarkus-roq-frontmatter.adoc#pagination[paginate].
<2> `post.image` is smart and is already resolved to the image url (as a RoqUrl).
<3> `post.url` contains the post url (as a RoqUrl), you could also use `post.url.absolute` to get the absolute url.
<4> `post.date` returns a `ZonedDateTime` and can be formatted the way you want.
<5> `post.readTime` is a Qute template extension which compute the read time based on the post content.

=== Static files

By default, all files in `static/` are treated as static..

=== Styles and Javascript

NOTE: The Quarkus Web Bundler is included by default with the Roq extension.

You can add css and scripts in your static directory or bundle them.
To use bundling scripts (js, ts) and styles (css, scss) should be located in `src/main/web/app/`. To include the generated bundle in your template, specify the bundle tag in the `html>head` tag:

[source,html]
.layouts/head.html
----
<head>
  ...
  {#bundle /}
</head>
----

It will be rendered with the relevant `<script>` and `<style>` tags to include your bundle.

You may also consume and bundle npm dependencies among other cool things.
For more info, read the https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-web-bundler/dev/[Quarkus Web Bundler documentation].
