= Roq the basics
include::../../includes/attributes.adoc[]
:doc-name: basics

include::../../includes/edit-contrib.adoc[]

By default, your site files should be located in the **project root directory** (or in the Java resources dir: `src/main/resources/`).

== Qute and FrontMatter

All templates may use the awesome type-safe https://quarkus.io/guides/qute-reference[Qute] template engine.

[TIP]
====
Type-safety doesn't make it more complex—it just means that using wrong variables will result in a build error.  
This prevents issues from leaking into production.
====

Templates for layouts, documents, and pages may also declare a FrontMatter (FM) header, delimited by two `---`.  
This header contains YAML data used to configure things like:

* Routing
* Data for templates
* Content generation
* Pagination

For example, a page template `blog-post.html` might start with:

[source,yaml]
----
---
title: "My First Blog Post"
date: 2025-09-08
author: "Andy"
layout: post
tags: qute, roq, tutorial
---

**Hello World**
----

== Content

The `content/` directory contains the <<site-index, site index page>> and all the <<pages>> and <<collections>> (such as blog posts). It may also contain attached static files (<<page-files>>).
Content templates can be written in `html`, `json`, `yaml`, `yml`, or `xml` or using <<Markup languages>>.

NOTE: We sometimes refer to pages in collections as documents, documents are just a special kind of pages.

[#templates]
== Templates (Layouts, Partials, and User Tags)

Layouts, partials, and user tags are templates and must use one of the following extensions:  
`html`, `xhtml`, `htm`, `json`, `yaml`, `yml`, or `xml`.

INFO: `.md` and `.adoc` files are not parsed as templates. Instead, you can use markup inside templates through Qute sections `{#md}` and `{#adoc}`, provided the corresponding <<Markup languages,plugins>> are available.

=== Layouts 

For your site, you will have one or more kind of pages, this is what we call "layouts", located by default in `templates/layouts/`. For example:

* `main`: the base layout for all kind of pages
* `page`: the layout of normal pages
* `post`: the layout for blog posts
* `recipe`: the layout for recipes or whatever

A layout may be specified in pages through the `layout` FrontMatter key (e.g., `layout: page`). By default (if the content of the file is not a full HTML page — i.e., it does not contain a `<html>` tag or `<!DOCTYPE` declaration), `posts` will use the `post` layout and normal pages will use the `page` layout. This can be configured through xref:advanced.adoc#quarkus-roq-frontmatter_site-page-layout[site configuration].

TIP: Roq layouts are using the Qute `include` section under the hood to achieve template inheritance. For more details, see the Qute documentation on includes: https://quarkus.io/guides/qute-reference#include_helper[Qute includes]. Unlike <<partials, partials>>, layouts can also define Frontmatter data, which is inherited along with the template structure.

NOTE: if you don't already have layouts and partials in your project, <<install-theme>> or create your own templates (https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-roq/tree/main/roq-theme/default/src/main/resources/templates[example templates]).

==== How to create a layout page

If you’re using a theme, you can take advantage of its layouts, but you’re also free to add your own. Layouts are built on a powerful inheritance system, allowing flexibility and customization.

// https://excalidraw.com/#json=NMbfajh74vODDIkfujKt8,0M5Vbhdd3oN02Nn-dgcbiw
image::roq-layouts.png[Roq - Layouts]

TIP: When using a theme, you can create new layouts that extend the existing theme layouts or partially override them to better suit your needs. Learn more here: xref:advanced.adoc#overriding-theme[Overriding Theme].


In this sample we will create a simple 3 steps inheritance layout. All below files should be located in the `templates/layouts/` directory.

To do so, you will first need a `default.html` file as followed:

[source,html]
.default.html
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>{page.title}</title> <1>
</head>
<body>
    {#insert /} <2>
</body>
</html>
----
<1> Use the `title` page attribute that will be defined by the using page
<2> Allows to insert arbitrary content from the page using the layout.

Then you can create a `main.html` file as followed:

[source,html]
.main.html
----
---
layout: default <1>
title: And now for something completely different <2>
---
<header> Head </header>
{#insert /}
<footer> Toes </footer>
----
<1> Uses the `default` layout.
<2> Defines a default `title` attribute value for all it's child.

Finally, you can create a `content.html` file as followed:

[source,html]
.content.html
----
---
layout: main <1>
---
{#include partials/image /} <2>
knees
----
<1> Uses the `main` layout.
<2> Includes a <<partials, partial>> template.

Then it will be rendered as followed:

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>And now for something completely different</title>
</head>
<body>
    <header> Head </header>
        <img src="https://supersimple.com/wp-content/uploads/head-shoulders-knees-and-toes-flashcards-726x1024.png" alt="Illustration" />
        knees
    <footer> toes </footer>
</body>
</html>
----

To summarize, each page will be rendered using their parent layout _recursively_. The inheritance system works for the page content as mush as for the FrontMatter data.


=== Partials

You can split layouts into partial, reusable templates.  
**Partials** make it easier to maintain different sections of your layouts. By default, they are located in `templates/partials/`.

For example:

➡️ `templates/partials/pagination.html`  
  can be included using: `{#include partials/pagination /}`

=== Tags

Tags (User Tags) are custom reusable snippets of code, similar to small components.  
They help reduce duplication and let you create reusable sections.

For example, create a tag in `templates/partials/post-link.html`:

[source,html]
----
{@io.quarkiverse.roq.frontmatter.runtime.model.DocumentPage post}
<div class="post-link">
    <a href="{post.url}">
      <img src="{post.image}" alt="{post.title}" class="post-image"/>
      <h3>{post.title}</h3>
      <p>{post.description}</p>
    </a>
</div>
----

You can then use it in another template like this :

[source,html]
----
{#post-link post=site.document('posts/2025-09-08-my-article.md')/}
----

This would render a styled card linking to the given `DocumentPage` post.

[TIP]
====
You can reference pages and documents by their source path.

For example:

* `site.document('posts/2025-09-08-my-article.md')`
* `site.page('about.md')`
==== 

To learn more, see the https://quarkus.io/guides/qute-reference#user_tags[Qute User Tags guide,window=_blank].



[#install-theme]
== Install a theme

To install a theme, simply add the dependency to your pom.xml. Example with Roq's default theme:
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.roq</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-roq-theme-default</artifactId>
    <version>{cdi:project-info.release.current-version}</version>
</dependency>
----


It will provide templates, scripts and styles for your site. To use a theme layout, refer to it with `:theme/` prefix (there is an example in the next part). For advanced usage, refer to the xref:advanced.adoc#themes[*Theme section*].

[#site-index]
== Site index

Your site index page is required and should be located in `content/index.html` (you can also use a markup extension).

[source,html]
.content/index.html
----
---

title: Hello Roqers // <1>
description: It is time to start Roqing 🎸!
layout: :theme/index //<2>

---

<h1>Hello fellow Roqers 🤘</h1>

<p>
  With Roq, it is very easy to a link to another.
  <a href="{site.url('/roq-page')}">page</a>. // <3>
</p>

----

<1> The index.html also describe your `site` information through a FrontMatter header.
<2> The layout to use (in this case `:theme/index` which refers to the `index` layout from the theme).
<3> We use the `{site.url(path)}` using Qute to manual resolve other pages urls.

TIP: There are different ways to link your pages as explained in the  link:{site-baseurl}docs/advanced#links[Links & Urls] section.

== Variables

You can use Qute to access site and pages data. For this use the `site` and `page` variables:

* The `site` (link:{roqjavadocurl}model/Site.html[javadoc,window=_blank]) variable allow to access site global info from any page, document, layout or partial.

== Pages

Any <<content, content template file>> without the `_` prefix in the site `content/` directory (and subdirectories) will be scanned as pages.

Let's create your first page and spice things up a bit by using Markdown (included by default with Roq).

[source,markdown]
.roq-bottom.md
----
---

title: Roq Bottom
description: When you hit Roq bottom, try Roq to climb back up!
layout: :theme/page
link: /climb-back-up <1>
the-rope: You Roq! <2>

---

# Roq Bottom

If you thought you hit Roq Bottom, take this 🪢 because :

__{page.data.the-rope}!__ <3>

----

<1> you can use `link` to give this page a custom link (by default it will use the file-name).
<2> you can add other FM data.
<3> FM data is available through `page.data`.

== Markup languages

You can use different markup languages in Roq content.

=== Markdown

Roq ships with Markdown support out of the box (powered by https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark-java[commonmark-java,window=_blank]).  
To write pages or documents in Markdown, simply use the `.md` or `.markdown` file extension.

This plugin also allows converting *Qute* data that contains Markdown
into HTML using the `mdToHtml` template extension.

[source,html]
.content/page.html
----
---
bar: |
    ## Hello

    This is using **Markdown** 
---

{page.data.foo.mdToHtml}

----

[TIP]
====
If you don’t need Markdown, you can disable it by excluding the Markdown plugin from the Roq extension in your `pom.xml`.
====



=== AsciiDoc

AsciiDoc is also fully supported in Roq via the xref:plugins.adoc#plugin-asciidoc[AsciiDoc plugin].
Once installed, to write pages or documents in AsciiDoc, simply use the `.adoc` or `.asciidoc` file extension.

== Global data

It is possible to declare global data as yaml or json in `data/` directory.

For example:

[source,markdown]
.data/foo.yml
----
bar: Roq
----

Can be access with `{cdi:foo.bar}` in any template.

You can also have a structure (Java type mapping) for the data amongs other feature,  link:https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-roq/dev/quarkus-roq-data.html#_data_mapping[learn more,window=_blank].

== Template Extensions

The Qute templating language supports a concept called https://quarkus.io/guides/qute#template-extension-methods[template extension methods]. These methods allow us to add functional to types and expose it in our templates. Moving logic from the template to Java code gives us the ability to use a more robust language for more complex logic and makes the functionality more easily reusable,as well as keeping our templates clean:

- Qute provides https://quarkus.io/guides/qute-reference#built-in-template-extension[built-in template extensions,window=_blank]
- Roq has several built-in template extensions (link:{roqjavadocurl}RoqTemplateExtension.html[javadoc,window=_blank]):

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Usage in a Qute template | Description

| ``text.numberOfWords``
| Returns the number of words in the string

| ``text.wordLimit(limit)``
| Returns the text limited to `limit` words, adds "..." if truncated

| ``text.slugify``
| Returns a slugified version of the text

| ``htmlContent.contentAbstract(limit)``
| Returns the HTML content limited to `limit` words

| ``htmlContent.stripHtml``
| Returns the text with all HTML tags removed

| ``page.readTime``
| Returns the estimated reading time in minutes for the page content

| ``page.contentAbstract``
| Returns the first 75 words of the page content

| ``page.contentAbstract(limit)``
| Returns the page content limited to `limit` words

| ``list.randomise``
| Returns the list in random order

| ``jsonArray.asJsonObjects``
| Returns a list of JsonObject. All items must be JSON objects.

| ``collections.collection(key)``
| Returns the collection for the given key

| ``posts.filter(key, value)``
| Returns only documents matching the front-matter key/value

| ``posts.future``
| Returns only documents dated in the future

| ``posts.past``
| Returns only documents dated in the past

| ``posts.sortBy(key, reverse)``
| Sorts documents by a front-matter key (string), optionally reversed

| ``posts.sortByDate(reverse)``
| Sorts documents by date, optionally reversed

| ``field.asStrings``
| Normalizes a front-matter field into a list of strings

| ``fileName.mimeType``
| Returns the MIME type based on the file name extension
|===

You can provide your own template extensions by adding a class to your projects `src/main/java` directory and annotating either class or the `public static` method with `@TemplateExtension`:

[source,java]
-----
public class Extensions {
    @TemplateExtension
    public static String doSomething(String text) {
        // ....
    }
}
-----

and then you can use that extension in your template:

[source,asciidoc]
-----
{site.pageContent(page).doSomething}
-----

For more details, see the https://quarkus.io/guides/qute#template-extension-methods[Quarkus] and https://quarkus.io/guides/qute-reference#virtual_methods[Qute] documentation.

== Collections

Collections are a great way to group related content such as blog posts, recipes, member of a team or talks at a conference.
Once created you can easily iterate and link to them.

By default, Roq is configured with a `posts` collection using the `content/posts` directory. Let's create our first post:

[source,markdown]
.content/posts/2024-10-14-roq-solid.md
----
---

title: Roq bad puns
description: Roq is very good for bad puns 🤭
layout: :theme/post <1>
tags: <2>
  - funny
  - ai
img: 2024/10/roq-solid.jpg

---

# {page.title} <3>

Here is a list of puns suggested by Chat GPT:
1.	Roq and Rule – A play on “rock and roll,” implying dominance or success.
2.	Between a Roq and a Hard Place – Classic pun meaning stuck in a difficult situation.
3.	Roq Solid – Something that is extremely reliable or stable.
4.	You Roq! – A compliment, suggesting someone is awesome or does something well.
5.	Roq Bottom – Referring to the lowest possible point, often used metaphorically.
6.	Roq the Boat – To cause trouble or disturb the status quo.
7.	Roq Star – A person who excels or stands out in their field.
8.	Let’s Roq – Slang for getting started or doing something exciting.
9.	Roq On! – An enthusiastic way to say “keep going” or “stay awesome.”
10.	Roqy Road – Could be literal (the type of road) or metaphorical for a difficult journey.
11.	Roq of Ages – A historical reference, often implying something long-standing and unchanging.
12.	Roq the Cradle – Can be literal or a pun about nurturing or starting something new.
13.	Roqy Relationship – A tumultuous or unstable relationship.
14.	Heavy as a Roq – Something burdensome or difficult to manage.
15.	Stone Cold Roq – Referring to something very cool or emotionless.

----
<1> This time we use the `post` layout from the theme.
<2> You can define tags (see xref:plugins.adoc#plugin-tagging[Plugins] to create pages for tags).
<3> You have shortcut on the `page` to access `title` and `description`.

Ok, to dive a bit deeper, we could create a json listing all posts with some info:

[source,html]
.content/posts.json
----
[
{#for post in site.collections.posts} // <1>
  {
    "title": "{post.title}",
    "url": "{post.url.absolute}", // <2>
    "image": "{post.image.absolute}", // <3>
    "date": "{post.date}", // <4>
    "read-time": "{post.readTime}" // <5>
  }{#if !post_isLast},{/if}
{/for}
]
----
<1> You can use `site.collections.[collection id]` to access the full list of documents (it is also possible to  xref:advanced.adoc#pagination[paginate]).
<2> `post.image` is smart and is already resolved to the image url (as a RoqUrl), `absolute` to get the absolute url.
<3> `post.url` contains the post url (as a RoqUrl), you could also use `absolute` to get the absolute url.
<4> `post.date` returns a `ZonedDateTime` and can be formatted the way you want.
<5> `post.readTime` is a Qute template extension which compute the read time based on the post content.

=== Draft and Future

To create a draft page or document, you can use the frontmatter field `draft: true`. Drafts won’t be visible when published unless you set `%dev.site.draft=true` in your Quarkus configuration (the `%dev` makes it apply only in dev mode).

You can also place draft documents (for collections) in a `drafts/` (e.g. `posts/drafts/`) directory.

TIP: You may also start quarkus with the option: `quarkus dev -Dsite.draft`.

By default, documents with a date in the future (FrontMatter data or file name) will not be visible unless you have `%dev.site.future=true` in your Quarkus configuration (the `%dev`makes it only available in dev-mode). 

TIP: You may also start quarkus with the option: `quarkus dev -Dsite.future`.

It is possible to configure a collection to always show future documents:
[source,properties]
----
site.collections.events.future=true // <1> 
----
<1> Always show future documents for the "events" collection.

=== How to create custom collections?

You can easily create your own collection, such as documentation, recipes, team members, or conference talks. To do this, simply create a new folder under the `content` directory. For example, if you're adding `docs`, it would look like this:

[source]
----
content/
├── docs
│   ├── 01-chap
│   │   ├── image1.png
│   │   └── index.adoc
│   ├── 02-chap
│   │   ├── image2.png
│   │   ├── index.adoc
└── posts
    └── 2025-01-02-my-first-blog
        └── index.md
----

In this example, we have two collections: `posts` and `docs`. Finally, you need to define the new collection in the `config/application.properties` (or `src/main/resources/application.properties`) file using the following properties:

[source]
----
site.collections.docs=true // <1>
site.collections.docs.layout=":theme/post" //<2>
site.collections.docs.future=true // <3>

site.collections.posts=true
site.collections.posts.layout=":theme/post"
----

<1> We are adding the new collection `docs`;
<2> Here, we are declaring the `docs` layout;
<3> Finally, since the new collection is not a time-based collection, we need to set `future` as true to show all files.

NOTE: Since we're adding a new collection, it's also necessary to declare the existing `posts` collection to ensure it continues to function correctly.

Now, we can access all the new collection `docs` data as follows:

[source]
----
{#for doc in site.collections.docs}
- [{doc.title}]({doc.url})
{/for}
----

Since the new collection is also a normal page, we can use all variables described in the link:#variables[variable section].

[#site-static]
== Site static files

Site static files are served as-is without any additional processing. By default, all files in `public/` are scanned as static files.

[source]
----
public/
├── images/image.jpg // <1>
├── scripts/script (2).js // <2>
└── presentation.pdf // <3>
----
<1> generated as on `/images/image.jpg`
<2> generated as `/scripts/script-2.js`(slugified 👇)
<3> generated as `/presentation.pdf`

Site static files url can be accessed through `site.file('presentation.pdf')` or `site.file('scripts/script (2).js')` or just their relative paths.

TIP: `site.file(path)` also checks that the file exists on disk and will adapt on site configuration (e.g. root path change).

To improve SEO, all static files are *slugified*, Roq replaces non-URL-friendly characters with `-`. URL-friendly characters are alphanumeric, `-`, and `_` (multiple dots are also tolerated for files). Using `site.file` and `page.file` variables automatically applies this replacement on returned url (same for images). To disable this behavior, set `site.slugify-files=false` in Roq’s configuration.


[#page-files]
== Page attached static files

Pages may have attached static files (image, pdf, slides, ...). For this, instead of creating a file page, create a directory with an index page:

[source]
----
content/my-page/
        ├── image.jpg // <1>
        ├── slide.pdf // <1>
        └── index.md  // <2>
----

<1> Every non page files in the directory will be attached to the page.
<2> Use an index.(html,md,...) for the page content;

TIP: this also works in collections.

In that case, those attached files will be served under the same path as the page and can be accessed via a relative link:
[source,markdown]
----
[slide](./slide.pdf)
----

The resulting link for a page can be different from its directory name, attached files will be relative to the resulting link. This way it works both in IDEs preview and in the browser.

Let's imagine for a minute that the page link is `https://my-site.org/awesome-page/`, then the slide will be served on `https://my-site.org/awesome-page/slide.pdf`.

You can use `{page.file("slide.pdf")}` to resolve the file url *and check that the file exists*. This is also useful in other cases, for example from another page (e.g. `{site.page("my-page/index.md").file("slide.pdf")}`) or if you want the absolute url (e.g. `{page.file("slide.pdf").absolute}`):

TIP: If you want to iterate over page files, they can be listed using `{page.files}`.

=== Images

This section explains how to access images in your site or in a specific page.

==== Site images

Site‑level images live in `public/images/` (e.g. `my-site/public/images/image-1.png`).

The default public path is `images/` and can be customized in the site configuration.

Use `site.image()` to generate the correct URL:

```html
<img src="{site.image('image-1.png')}" />
```

TIP: `site.image(name)` is equivalent to:

```html
<img src="{site.file('images/' + name)}" />
```

==== Page images

When a page is a directory (for example `posts/surf/index.html`), the method `{page.image(name)}` checks if the image is attached to that page and returns its URL.

For single‑file pages (`posts/basketball.md`), `{page.image(name)}` behaves like `site.image(name)` and resolves from `public/images/`.

Example structure:

```
my-site/

<1> Non-directory pages → `page.image()` == `site.image()`.  
<2> Page-attached file → accessible via `{page.image('surf.jpg')}`.  
<3> Site images → accessible everywhere via `site.image(name)`.

==== Usage example

_File: `surf-article/index.html`_

```html
---
image: cover.jpg
---
<h2>👍</h2>
<img src="surf.jpg" />                       <!-- 1 -->
<img src="{page.image()}" />                 <!-- 2 -->
<img src="{page.image('surf.jpg')}" />       <!-- 3 -->
<img src="{site.image('basketball.jpg')}" /> <!-- 4 -->
<img src="{site.image('basketball.png').absolute}" /> <!-- 5 -->

<h2>👎</h2>
<img src="{site.image('surf.jpg')}" />       <!-- 6 -->
<img src="{page.image('soccer.jpg')}" />     <!-- 6 -->
<img src="{page.image('basketball.jpg')}" /> <!-- 6 -->
```

=== Page & Site cover image

Page cover image is referenced in the page FM `image` data.
[source,yaml]
.some-page.md
----
---
image: my-page.png
---

{page.image}
----

The url can be accessed from this template (and its parent layouts) through `{page.image}`.

[source,yaml]
.index.html
----
---
image: my-site.png
---
----

It can be accessed in any template through `{site.image}`.

== Styles and Javascript

Here are two options to consume scripts and styles:

* Add css and scripts in your site static directory, see <<site-static>> section.
* Use the Quarkus Web Bundler to bundle your script and styles 👇.

NOTE: The Quarkus Web Bundler is included by default in Roq.

To use bundling scripts (js, ts) and styles (css, scss), locate them in `src/main/resources/web/app/`.

[source]
----
my-site/
├── src/main/resources/web/app/
│                           ├── scripts.js
│                           └── styles.scss
----


To include the generated bundle in your template, specify the bundle tag in the `html>head` tag:

[source,html]
.layouts/head.html
----
<head>
  ...
  {#bundle /}
</head>
----

It will be rendered with the relevant `<script>` and `<style>` tags to include your bundle.

TIP: You may also consume and bundle npm dependencies among other cool things.
