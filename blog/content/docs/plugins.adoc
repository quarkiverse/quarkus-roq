[#plugin-tagging]
== Roq Plugin Tagging

This plugin allows to generate a dynamic (derived) collection based on a given collection tags.

To install it:
[source,shell]
----
quarkus ext add quarkus-roq-plugin-tagging
----

For example, let's consider the posts collection, if multiple posts have `tags: guide`, then we would generate a `/posts/tag/guide` page for all the posts containing the `guide` tag. This works for any collection.


To enable tagging, create a layout template, add `tagging: [collection id]` in FM. As a result you will have access to a new derived collection named `tagCollection`. It is available through `site.collections.get(page.data.tagCollection)`:


[source,html]
.templates/layouts/tag.html
----
---
layout: main
tagging: posts
---

{#for post in site.collections.get(page.data.tagCollection)}
  <div>{post.title}</div>
{/for}

----


This also support pagination like any other collection, as tagging is already specifying the target collection, pagination can be enabled just with in FM `paginate: true`:

[source,html]
.templates/layouts/tag.html
----
---
layout: main
tagging: posts
paginate: true
---

{#for post in site.collections.get(page.data.tagCollection).paginated(page.paginator)}
  <div>{post.title}</div>
{/for}

----

[#plugin-aliases]
== Roq Plugin Aliases

This plugin allows creating one or many aliases (redirections) for a page.

To install it:

[source,shell]
----
quarkus ext add quarkus-roq-plugin-aliases
----

For example, consider that you want to create a shortened link for your post.

To create an alias, create a page and add `aliases: [your-alias-here, another-alias-here]` in the Front Matter (FM). As a result, you will have the possibility to access the page using a customized URL as alias.

[source,yaml]
.content/posts/2024-08-29-welcome-to-roq.md
----
---
layout: :theme/post
title: "Welcome to Roq!"
date: 2024-08-29 13:32:20 +0200
description: This is the first article ever made with Quarkus Roq
img: posts/2024/08/blogging.jpg
tags: blogging
author: ia3andy
aliases: [first-roq-article-ever]
---
----

Now, when you access the URL `http://localhost:8081/first-roq-article-ever`, you will be redirected to the `2024-08-29-welcome-to-roq` blog post.

NOTE: you can use link templating in aliases

[#plugin-asciidoc]
== Roq Plugin AsciiDoc

This plugin allows to use asciidoc to produce content.


[NOTE]
====
There are two implementations of Asciidoc for Roq:

1. *Asciidoc (Java)*: Provides fast startup and native build compatibility but has limited features and does not support extensions.
2. *Asciidoc JRuby*: Offers the full feature set of Asciidoctor but is slower to start and incompatible with native builds.
====

To install it:

[source,shell]
----
quarkus ext add quarkus-roq-plugin-asciidoc
----

or

To install it:

[source,shell]
----
quarkus ext add quarkus-roq-plugin-asciidoc-jruby
----

Once done, every file with either '.adoc' or '.asciidoc' extension will be processed.

WARNING: For better security, Asciidoc includes have been disabled, use Qute includes instead.

[#plugin-markdown]
== Roq Plugin Markdown

This plugin allows to use markdown to produce content.

NOTE: Markdown plugin is already included in Quarkus Roq extension.

To install it run:
[source,shell]
----
quarkus ext add quarkus-roq-plugin-markdown
----

Once done, every file with either '.md' or '.markdown' extension will be processed.

[#plugin-qrcode]
== Roq Plugin QR Code

This plugin allows you to add a QR Code to your website.

To install it run:
[source,shell]
----
quarkus ext add quarkus-roq-plugin-qrcode
----


Then create a template and add the `{#qrcode ...}` tag to it and style and size it as you want.

By default, the plugin produces HTML output compatible with both `HTML` and `MarkDown` templates. To use the plugin with `asciidoc`, set the `asciidoc` attribute to `true` (the default is `false`).

[source,mixed]
----
{#qrcode value="https://luigis.com/menu/" alt="Luigi's Menu" foreground="#000066" background="#FFFFFF" width=300 height=300 /} // Will generate HTML code
{#qrcode value="https://luigis.com/menu/" alt="Luigi's Menu" foreground="#000066" background="#FFFFFF" width=300 height=300 asciidoc=true/} // Will save the file in the static folder and generate an asciidoc image macro pointing to it
----

[#plugin-series]
== Roq Plugin Series

This plugin allows you to join multiple posts in a series.

To install it run:
[source,shell]
----
quarkus ext add quarkus-roq-plugin-series
----


Edit the layout for your posts, for example when using roq-default theme:

[source,html]
.templates/layouts/roq-default/post-series.html
----
---
layout: theme-layouts/roq-default/post
---

{#include partials/roq-series /} //<1>

{#insert /} //<2>

----
<1> This will add the series partial before the post content, if it's declared.
<2> This is the post content

And finally, use this layout and add the `series` attribute in the Front Matter of the posts you want to join.

[source,yaml]
----

layout: series-post
title: Assemble you blog post in a series
description: Automatically series header for your posts

author: John Doe
series: My series Title // <1>
