[#plugin-tagging]
== Roq Plugin Tagging (Tags)

This plugin allows to generate a dynamic (derived) collection based on a given collection tags.
For example, let's consider the posts collection, if multiple posts have `tags: guide`, then we would generate a `/posts/tag/guide` page for all the posts containing the `guide` tag. This works for any collection.


To install it:
[source,shell]
----
quarkus ext add quarkus-roq-plugin-tagging
----


If you are using a theme that supports it (includes a tagging layout), you should now have tags pages available for all the tags in your posts!

TIP: You can use  xref:advanced.adoc#overriding-theme[theme override] to customize the theme tagging layout.


To enable tagging without a theme, create a layout template and add `tagging: [collection id]` in FM. As a result you will have access to a new derived collection named `tagCollection`. It is available through `site.collections.get(page.data.tagCollection)`:

[source,html]
.templates/layouts/tag.html
----
---
layout: main
tagging: posts
---

{#for post in site.collections.get(page.data.tagCollection)}
  <div>{post.title}</div>
{/for}

----

This also support pagination like any other collection, as tagging is already specifying the target collection, pagination can be enabled just with in FM `paginate: true`:

[source,html]
.templates/layouts/tag.html
----
---
layout: main
tagging: posts
paginate: true
---

{#for post in site.collections.get(page.data.tagCollection).paginated(page.paginator)}
  <div>{post.title}</div>
{/for}

----

[#plugin-aliases]
== Roq Plugin Aliases (Redirections)

This plugin allows creating one or many aliases (redirections) for a page.

To install it:

[source,shell]
----
quarkus ext add quarkus-roq-plugin-aliases
----

For example, consider that you want to create a shortened link for your post.

To create an alias, create a page and add `aliases: [your-alias-here, another-alias-here]` in the Front Matter (FM). As a result, you will have the possibility to access the page using a customized URL as alias.

[source,yaml]
.content/posts/2024-08-29-welcome-to-roq.md
----
---
layout: :theme/post
title: "Welcome to Roq!"
date: 2024-08-29 13:32:20 +0200
description: This is the first article ever made with Quarkus Roq
img: posts/2024/08/blogging.jpg
tags: blogging
author: ia3andy
aliases: [first-roq-article-ever]
---
----

Now, when you access the URL `http://localhost:8081/first-roq-article-ever`, you will be redirected to the `2024-08-29-welcome-to-roq` blog post.

NOTE: you can use link templating in aliases

[#plugin-asciidoc]
== Roq Plugin AsciiDoc

This plugin allows to use asciidoc to produce content.

[NOTE]
====
There are two implementations of Asciidoc for Roq:

1. *Asciidoc (Java)*: Provides fast startup and native build compatibility but has limited features and does not support extensions.
2. *Asciidoc JRuby*: Offers the full feature set of Asciidoctor but is slower to start and incompatible with native builds.
====

To install it:

[source,shell]
----
quarkus ext add quarkus-roq-plugin-asciidoc
----

or

[source,shell]
----
quarkus ext add quarkus-roq-plugin-asciidoc-jruby
----

Once done, every file with either '.adoc' or '.asciidoc' extension will be processed.

WARNING: For better security, Asciidoc includes have been disabled, use Qute includes instead.

[#plugin-markdown]
== Roq Plugin Markdown

This plugin allows to use markdown to produce content.

NOTE: Markdown plugin is already included in Quarkus Roq extension.

To install it run:
[source,shell]
----
quarkus ext add quarkus-roq-plugin-markdown

[#plugin-qrcode]
== Roq Plugin QR Code

This plugin allows you to add a QR Code to your website.

To install it run:
[source,shell]
----
quarkus ext add quarkus-roq-plugin-qrcode

Then create a template and add the `\{#qrcode ...}` tag to it and style and size it as you want.

By default, the plugin produces HTML output compatible with both `HTML` and `MarkDown` templates. To use the plugin with `asciidoc`, set the `asciidoc` attribute to `true` (the default is `false`).

[source,mixed]
----
\{#qrcode value="https://luigis.com/menu/" alt="Luigi's Menu" foreground="#000066" background="#FFFFFF" width=300 height=300 /} // Will generate HTML code
\{#qrcode value="https://luigis.com/menu/" alt="Luigi's Menu" foreground="#000066" background="#FFFFFF" width=300 height=300 asciidoc=true/} // Will save the file in the static folder and generate an asciidoc image macro pointing to it

[#plugin-series]
== Roq Plugin Series

This plugin allows you to join multiple posts in a series.

To install it run:

----
quarkus ext add quarkus-roq-plugin-series

Edit the layout for your posts, for example when using roq-default theme:

[source,html]
.templates/layouts/roq-default/post-series.html
----
---
layout: theme-layouts/roq-default/post
---

{#include partials/roq-series /} //<1>

{#insert /} //<2>

----
<1> This will add the series partial before the post content, if it's declared.
<2> This is the post content

And finally, use this layout and add the `series` attribute in the Front Matter of the posts you want to join.

[source,yaml]
----
---
layout: series-post
title: Assemble you blog post in a series

[#plugin-diagram]
== Roq Plugin Diagram

If you're using ROQ you already know that documentation-as-code will soon rule the world, and you probably also know diagram-as-code is its little brother.

The diagram as code helps you use almost every diagram-as-code language by leveraging _**Kroki.io**_.

It delegates image rendering to *_Kroki_* either by using a provided server or by popping a dev service.

Please take a look at https://kroki.io/[the full reference documentation].

To install it, you will to do the following:

. Add the plugin:
+
[source,shell]
----
quarkus ext add quarkus-roq-plugin-diagram
----
. Use it in your content:
+
[source,html]
----
\{#diagram asciidoc=true language="pikchr" alt="Impossible trident" width=500 height=500 diagramOutputFormat="svg"}

scale = 1.0
eh = 0.5cm
ew = 0.2cm
ed = 2 * eh
er = 0.4cm
lws = 4.0cm
lwm = lws + er
lwl = lwm + er

ellipse height eh width ew
L1: line width lwl from last ellipse.n
line width lwm from last ellipse.s
LV: line height eh down

move right er down ed from last ellipse.n
ellipse height eh width ew
L3: line width lws right from last ellipse.n to LV.end then down eh right ew
line width lwm right from last ellipse.s then to LV.start

move right er down ed from last ellipse.n
ellipse height eh width ew
line width lwl right from last ellipse.n then to L1.end
line width lwl right from last ellipse.s then up eh
\{/}
----

You can either use a deployed server or let the dev services provide one for you, but in this case you won't have https://hub.docker.com/r/yuzutech/kroki[all languages available].

Just try it, you'll see what it does.
