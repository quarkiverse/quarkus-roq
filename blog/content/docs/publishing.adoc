[#generating]
== Generating your Roq site

This command:
[source,shell]
----
quarkus build -Dquarkus.roq.generator.batch
quarkus run
----

🚀 The site will be generated in `target/roq`.


Here is a one-liner using Maven:

[source,shell]
----
QUARKUS_ROQ_GENERATOR_BATCH=true ./mvnw -B package quarkus:run
----

[#github-action]
== Roq GitHub Action

Roq provides a https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-roq/blob/main/action.yml[GitHub action] to publish to GitHub pages or other services.

[[github-pages]]
=== To GitHub Pages

Check if you already have the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file, if you don't create it:

{|
..github/workflows/deploy.yml
[source,yaml]
----
## Deploy to GH-Pages for your Quarkus Roq site.
name: Roq Site Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]   # Switch to the branch which should be deployed to GitHub Pages
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 5 * * *"  # Runs every day at 05:00 UTC (10:30 AM IST)
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Generate Roq Site
        uses: quarkiverse/quarkus-roq@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}   # Used to automatically get the GitHub Pages url
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    permissions:
      pages: write      # to deploy to Pages
      id-token: write   # to verify the deployment originates from an appropriate source
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
----
|}

Then to enable GitHub Pages:

1. *Open* your GitHub repository page
2. **Go to** Settings->Page
3. *Pick:* `Source: GitHub Actions`, that's enough (no save button)

It's all good, restart your deploy workflow and enjoy!

=== To other services

..github/workflows/deploy-other.yml
[source,yaml]
----
## Deploy to another service for your Quarkus Roq site.
name: Roq Site Deploy other

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]   # Switch to the branch which should be deployed to GitHub Pages
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Generate Roq Site
        uses: quarkiverse/quarkus-roq@v1
        with:
          github-pages: false
      - name: Publishing blog
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: site
          path: target/roq
          retention-days: 3
----
|}

This will create a GitHub artifact named `site` that you can download from another job (or another workflow). For example, the PR Preview https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-roq/blob/main/.github/workflows/preview-pr.yml[workflow] of Roq publishes to Surge.

== Gitlab CI

Add this file at the root of your Gitlab repository

..gitlab-ci.yml
[source,yaml]
----
stages:
  - build
  - deploy

build_roq:
  # Look for appropriate maven docker images in https://hub.docker.com/_/maven/tags
  image: "maven:3.9.9-eclipse-temurin-23-alpine"
  stage: build
  # Generate the static site on merge request events and on the main branch
  script:
    - QUARKUS_ROQ_GENERATOR_BATCH=true mvn -B -q package quarkus:run
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"'
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH'
  artifacts:
    reports:
      junit: target/surefire-reports/*.xml
    paths:
      - target/roq
      - target/surefire-reports

deploy_roq:
  image: alpine
  pages: true
  stage: deploy
  # For main branch take the artifacts from `build_roq` and deploy them.
  needs:
    - build_roq
  script:
    - cp -R target/roq public
    - echo "Quarkus Roq static site deployed to Gitlab Pages at $CI_PAGES_URL"
  rules:
    - if: '$CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH'
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public
----

If everything goes well the pipeline will deploy, the url of the deployment is found via these options:

* Console output of `deploy_roq` job.
* Clicking `Deploy` => `Pages` on the project sidebar
* Navigating to the url `\https://gitlab.example.com/user-or-organization/projectpath/project/pages`

== Other CIs

Using the command above should be easy to configure on any CI.

TIP: if you created a configuration for a given CI which could help others, please share it here (or create an issue) 🙏
