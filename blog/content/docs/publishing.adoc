= Publishing a Roq Site

== Roq GitHub Action

Roq provides a https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-roq/blob/main/action.yml[GitHub action] to publish to GitHub pages or other services.

[[github-pages]]
=== To GitHub Pages

Check if you already have the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file, if you don't create it:

..github/workflows/deploy.yml
[source,yaml]
----
## Deploy to GH-Pages for your Quarkus Roq site.
name: Roq Site Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]   # Switch to the branch which should be deployed to GitHub Pages
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Generate Roq Site
        uses: quarkiverse/quarkus-roq@v1
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}   # Used to automatically get the GitHub Pages url
  deploy:
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    permissions:
      pages: write      # to deploy to Pages
      id-token: write   # to verify the deployment originates from an appropriate source
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
----

Then to enable GitHub Pages:

1. *Open* your GitHub repository page
2. **Go to** Settings->Page
3. *Pick:* `Source: GitHub Actions`, that's enough (no save button)

It's all good, restart your deploy workflow and enjoy!

== To other services

..github/workflows/deploy-other.yml
[source,yaml]
----
## Deploy to another service for your Quarkus Roq site.
name: Roq Site Deploy other

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]   # Switch to the branch which should be deployed to GitHub Pages
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Generate Roq Site
        uses: quarkiverse/quarkus-roq@v1
        with:
          github-pages: false
      - name: Publishing blog
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: site
          path: target/roq
          retention-days: 3

This will create a GitHub artifact named `site` that you can download from another job (or another workflow). For example, the PR Preview https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-roq/blob/main/.github/workflows/preview-pr.yml[workflow] of Roq publishes to Surge.

== Building Roq

Roq is based on Quarkus, you just need to set up a JDK to build your Roq site using this command:

[source,shell]
----
export QUARKUS_ROQ_GENERATOR_BATCH=true
./mvnw -B package quarkus:run
----

== Other CIs

Using the command above should be easy to configure on any CI.

TIP: if you created a configuration for a given CI which could help others, please share it here üôè
