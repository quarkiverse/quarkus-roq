# Contributing guide

**Want to contribute? Great!** We try to make it easy, and all contributions, even the smaller ones, are more than welcome. This includes bug reports, fixes, documentation, examples... But first, read this page.

## Reporting an issue

This project uses GitHub issues to manage the issues. Open an issue directly in GitHub.

If you believe you found a bug, and it's likely possible, please indicate a way to reproduce it, what you are seeing, and
what you would expect to see. Don't forget to indicate your Quarkus, Java, Maven/Gradle, and GraalVM versions.

## Tests and documentation are not optional

Don't forget to include tests in your pull requests. Also don't forget the documentation (reference documentation, javadoc, etc.).

### Running

This project uses Java 21 and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) as build tooling.

To run the tests, use the following:

```shell
mvn verify
```

### Code Style

Maven automatically formats code and organizes imports when you run `mvn verify`. So, we recommend you do that before sending your PR. Otherwise, PR checks will fail.

## Installing Roq extensions

To install all Roq extensions, we need to run:

```shell
mvn clean install
```

## Running Blog

There are two ways for running the blog post locally:

- **With live reload:** Great when you are writing your blog.
- **Serving your static site:** When you want to see how your blog looks, before the deployment.

### Running with live reload

Go to `blog` directory:

```shell
cd blog
```

And, to execute the following maven command:

```shell
mvn quarkus:dev
```

If you are using Quarkus CLI, you can use:

```shell
quarkus dev
```

Now, you can access: http://localhost:8080 and be happy!

### Serving your static site

See our documentation to see [how to generate your static files](https://docs.quarkiverse.io/quarkus-roq/dev/quarkus-roq-generator.html#_generating_your_static_site).

## For the maintainers
