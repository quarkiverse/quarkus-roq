# About Roq

Roq stands out in the Java development community as a powerful static site generator, bridging the gap between the
likes of Gatsby, Hugo, and the broader backend community. While tools like Jekyll once filled this space, they’ve become outdated and cumbersome,
especially with Ruby’s limitations.
Roq offers a modern solution, leveraging Quarkus with no configuration needed, allowing developers to start quickly
using Codestart and simply editing their site directory.

With GitHub Actions support out-of-the-box, Roq is easy to use for beginners, but also flexible enough to provide
  Java hooks for advanced users.

__This tool is a testament to how extensible and powerful Quarkus is, offering a low-risk yet highly capable platform that will evolve as demand grows.__
