This guide demonstrates how your Quarkus application can utilize Quarkus Messaging to interact with AMQP 1.0.

IMPORTANT: If you want to use RabbitMQ, you should use the xref:rabbitmq.adoc[Quarkus Messaging RabbitMQ extension].
Alternatively, if you want to use RabbitMQ with AMQP 1.0 you need to enable the AMQP 1.0 plugin in the RabbitMQ broker;
check the https://smallrye.io/smallrye-reactive-messaging/smallrye-reactive-messaging/3.9/amqp/amqp.html#amqp-rabbitmq[connecting to RabbitMQ]
documentation.

== Prerequisites

:prerequisites-docker-compose:
include::{includes}/prerequisites.adoc[]

== Architecture

In this guide, we are going to develop two applications communicating with an AMQP broker.
We will use https://activemq.apache.org/components/artemis/[Artemis], but you can use any AMQP 1.0 broker.
The first application sends a _quote request_ to an AMQP queue and consumes messages from the _quote_ queue.
The second application receives the _quote request_ and sends a _quote_ back.
