# About this site

This site is built with [Roq](https://iamroq.dev), a static site generator powered by [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io). It combines the best of tools like Jekyll and Hugo with the Java ecosystem: zero configuration to get started, blazing fast live-reload in dev mode, and full access to Java when you need it.
