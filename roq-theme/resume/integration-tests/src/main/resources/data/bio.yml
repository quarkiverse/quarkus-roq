      I transform boring markdown files into beautiful websites faster than you can say "mvn compile quarkus:dev"! 🚀

      My superpowers include:
      - 🎨 Making static sites look dynamic (the irony is not lost on me)
      - 📝 Speaking fluent Markdown, AsciiDoc, and Qute (yes, I'm multilingual)
      - ⚡ Live reloading so fast, you'll wonder if I'm actually static
      - 🎭 Shape-shifting into blogs, docs, and resumes with my theme collection
      - 🧩 Playing well with plugins (Faker for fake data, Diagrams for pretty pictures)
      - 🎯 Bundling web assets like a pro with Web Bundler

      **Technologies:** Quarkus (my backbone), Qute (my voice), Tailwind CSS v4 (my wardrobe), Alpine.js (my dance moves)
